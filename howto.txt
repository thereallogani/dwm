To install dwm from source:
 1. Set up config.h the way you want to (make sure paths to
    everything are correct)
 2. Run make (you may have to install some depencies first)
 3. Once compiled, install feh (or similar program) to manage
    the background. Then move scripts/.fehbg to you home directory
    and specify the path to whatever image you want for your
    background.
 4. Create a .fonts/ in your home directory move scripts/icons/icons.tff
    into it. These set the icons used in the status_line python script
 5. Copy user.desktop to /usr/share/xsessions (if you are using a
    display manager like gdm or lightdm, otherwise skip this) Also,
    make sure that the paths in here are correct. I had issues on Fedora
    with the path because the default /etc/X11/Xsession doesn't point to
    .Xsession scripts in users' home directories.
 6. Copy the .Xsession script into you home directory (unless you aren't
    using a display manager, in which case just move the commands to a
    .xinitrc) and again check to make sure that all the paths are correct.
    Also, make sure you are using gnome-screensaver or change that line
    out to whatever you're using.

After doing that, things should work. Hopefully.
